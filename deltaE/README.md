## deltaE

Two IPython notebooks.

* deltaE  - rude calcuations of energy deviation between a crystallographicaly-bound conformation of a fragment-alike molecule and its predicted minimum. Was used to evaluate energy cut off for conformer purging
* conformer_energies_nPMI_plot - snippet for plotting normalized principal moments of intertia (nPMI, PMI3/PMI1 vs PMI2/PMI1) for compound collections with multiple conformers embed, with energy of each conformer being hightlighted.
